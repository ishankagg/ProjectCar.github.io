	<strong>Ken miles</strong> was the lover of cars. He is the person behind beautiful The ford gt. I wrote this blog after getting to know about him. Movie  Ford vs Ferrari is about him. 
	In that movie his feelings for cars can seen.
	Miles was born on 1 November 1918 in Sutton Coldfield, a short distance from the city of Birmingham.[1] He was the son of Eric Miles and Clarice Jarvis.[2] After a failed attempt to run away to the United States,[3] Miles left school at the age of 15 to work as an apprentice at Wolseley Motors,[2] who sent him to a technical school to broaden his knowledge of vehicle construction.[3] He raced motorcycles before he served as a tank commander in the British Territorial Army in World War II.[2] Miles spent the next seven years working in machinery and was promoted to the rank of staff sergeant in 1942. He was stationed in a tank unit that took part in the Normandy landings in 1944
